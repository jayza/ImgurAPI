# ImgurAPI
This is an object-oriented php project to connect to the Imgur API. 
It is meant to be a learning experience for me, but the goal is that this software will be usable by anyone for what ever purpose.


Current version: 0.0.1

You can contact me at jake@kirkandstanley.se if you have any questions or if you're are interested in the project.
